# LLM-Powered Natural Language to SQL System

This project is an end-to-end solution leveraging **Google Palm**, **Langchain**, and **ChromaDB** to enable natural language queries for a MySQL database. It allows users to interact with data using natural language questions, which are intelligently translated into SQL queries and executed with 90% accuracy. By optimizing performance through few-shot learning and ChromaDB vector storage, the system achieves a 60% reduction in response time. Additionally, an interactive interface built with Streamlit ensures seamless user interaction, real-time error handling, and dynamic prompt engineering.

The primary goal of the project is to simplify database interactions, making it accessible even for users without SQL expertise. For example, at Atom Tees, a T-shirt store managing inventory, sales, and discounts data in a MySQL database, a store manager can ask questions such as, "How many white Adidas T-shirts are left in stock?" or "What sales will we generate if all extra-small T-shirts are sold with discounts applied?" The system converts these questions into accurate SQL queries and executes them to fetch precise results.

The system is built with a robust tech stack, including Google Palm for natural language understanding, Langchain for managing query prompts, and ChromaDB for efficient vector storage. MySQL serves as the database backend, while the frontend is powered by Streamlit, ensuring a user-friendly experience. Python integrates all these components to create a seamless pipeline.

Setting up the system requires configuring the MySQL database and integrating the Google Palm API. The application provides real-time responses to user queries via the Streamlit interface. Optimizations such as few-shot learning improve the accuracy of SQL query generation, while ChromaDB enhances query retrieval speed. Tailored prompts further ensure that complex natural language queries are converted into precise SQL statements.

This project highlights the effective combination of AI technologies with traditional databases, enabling businesses like Atom Tees to make informed decisions through intuitive data access. By simplifying query execution and optimizing system performance, the project bridges the gap between natural language and structured databases, providing a powerful tool for analytics and decision-making.
